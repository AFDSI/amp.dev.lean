Welcome to the AMP Translation Initiative!

Part of the AMP mission is to create the web a welcoming and accessible place for everyone, and translating our documentation is a vital piece to meeting this goal. The AMP Translation Initiative is working to create a network of native speakers to ensure our documentation is localized with clarity and efficiency.

Translation volunteers can contribute in many ways:
Translate documentation.
Update translated documentation.
Review translated documentation for accuracy and terminology.
Add to localization term glossaries.

AMP currently has an internal translation process for documentation. We are working with volunteers to best communicate what files are being translated and which ones require external assistance. Currently, our process is:

Create a GitHub Issue
Declare which language you are translating the document.
Name which file you wish to translate or update.
Give a rough estimation of how much of the file you are translating.
Full File
Partial File
Few Terms
Provide a general estimation of how much time it will take to complete the translation task.
Add @CrystalFaith to give status:
Yes! Please translate this!
Thanks for your interest, but the internal team or a volunteer is currently working on this document. You will be added as a reviewer before it goes live.

Some languages have created channels on slack where a localized documentation tracker has been created. We encourage you to join and introduce yourself!
