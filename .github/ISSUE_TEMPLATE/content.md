## ðŸ“– Missing or Out-of-Date Documentation

### Problem
A clear and concise description of what content is missing, or needs updating. It could be a missing guide explaining a concept, a step-by-step tutorial, or something that is confusing or doesn't work when you tried it.

### Location
In which part of the site would that content live?

### Content type
Such as tutorial, an updated paragraph, or reference docs?

### Information architecture proposal (optional)
If you have ideas on how we should structure the content, tell us!
