<!--
Thank you for wanting to add a Story creation resource resource to amp.dev.

The Stories submitted below will be run through the [AMP Linter](https://github.com/ampproject/amp-toolbox/tree/master/packages/linter) to ensure a minimum quality bar. In order to proceed, all Stories must pass all tests.

Any feedback will optionally be provided directly on the issue. Pending any outstanding changes, your tool will then be listed on amp.dev.

If your tool is already listed and you would like to change a description or image, please re-open the original issue created to list your resource on amp.dev.

The process will continue to be evaluated. Updated stories may be requested or tools violating any in place checks may get de-listed.

***Note:** While passing the AMP Linter ensures a minimum quality bar for a Story, it does not ensure that the story is of high quality and is enjoyable for users. It is highly recommended to build features and guardrails into your tools that help story creators adhere to the [Web Story Best Practices](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/start/create_successful_stories/).*

Please fill in the template below.
