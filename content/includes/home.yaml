      quote: “The mobile open web experience is terrible and some have suggested it's too slow to compete. We can choose to see the mobile open web as a relic of its time and flee to the warm embrace of closed platforms and apps. Or we can say that the open web means something important to the world and if it’s broken it’s our job to fix it. I think we should fix it. That’s why Chartbeat is proud to be a part of the Accelerated Mobile Pages Project. It’s our attempt to fix the mobile experience, make it fast and beautiful, and ensure the future of an open web.”
