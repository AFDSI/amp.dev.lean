  title@: Better advertising on a faster web.
  paragraph@: We can’t fix the web if we don’t fix ads. Today’s ads fail to meet advertisers’ goals because they are slow, unpredictable and disruptive. The open-source AMP Ads Initiative aims to make advertising on the web better with faster, lighter and more secure ad experiences, starting with ads and extending beyond the click to the pages users land on.

why:
  title@: Why AMP Ads
  reasons:
    - title@: Speed is the fastest way to drive performance
      paragraph@: The median load time for an AMP page is less than one second but the average ad still takes 5 seconds to load over 3G connections – that’s 4 seconds too late. When ads are faster, they’re more viewable, more effective, and more likely to perform well. Boost performance by speeding up ads with AMP Ads.

    - title@: Lighter ads improve brand perception
      paragraph@: Heavy and unpredictable ad experiences slow down the page, cost users money, and negatively impact perception of both the advertiser and the publisher. AMP Ads are 3x lighter than traditional ads, helping to ensure a positive brand experience.
      icon: amp-ads/ads_icon.svg

    - title@: Smart and coordinated ads boost campaign ROI
      paragraph@: The average mobile page makes 107 uncoordinated ad server requests. Redundant data requests slow down the page and prevent your ad from loading. AMP Ads leverage smart components like amp-analytics to reuse code and eliminate unnecessary data requests. As a result, AMP Ads access more data while loading faster. And when ads load faster, they’re more likely to exceed advertiser campaign goals and publisher revenue expectations.

    - title@: Build once, serve everywhere.
      description@: AMP Ads can serve on both AMP and non-AMP pages so you can build your AMP Ad once and deliver a memorable brand experience everywhere.
