These days, if it isn’t instant – its not fast enough. Even the most memorable creative won’t serve its purpose if the ad is slow and disruptive for a user. AMP is fundamentally changing the way ads are built, delivered and measured on the web, making them faster and minimizing disruptions for users. This increases viewability and click-through rates to improve monetization, making everyone happy: users, publishers and advertisers alike.

1. Boost performance – 3x lighter
2. Amplify your impact – 6x faster
3. Maximize your revenue – 13% more viewable

# A faster way to grow your business
A growing number of publishers and advertisers are adopting AMP to deliver faster and more engaging content to their users. As your clients embrace the speed of AMP and more users consume content on AMP pages, ensure that your business is positioned for the future and integrate your technology with AMP. Speeding up ads is the fastest way to boost performance.

Although AMP pages support traditional HTML ads, these ads can be slow to load. To make ads themselves as fast as the rest of the AMP page, you can build ads in [AMPHTML.](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/ads/google/a4a/docs/a4a-readme.md) AMPHTML ads load as fast as content, increasing viewability and enticing engement. AMPHTML ads are only delivered after being validated, ensuring that the ads are free of malware.

Ads created with AMPHTML are served on both AMP and non-AMP pages. By building an ad with AMP, you can deliver a memorable brand experience everywhere without worrying about speed and platform compatibility.

# AMP for advertisers
## Grow engagement and increase conversions with faster experiences

The average mobile site takes 19 seconds to load over a 3G connection. Coupled with the fact that conversions fall by 12% for every additional second a webpage takes to load, you can safely assume two things: speed equals performance, and most advertiser campaigns have room to improve. That’s where you come in. As an SSP, DSP, analytics provider, or anything in between, embracing speed means improving campaign performance, delivering quality user experiences, and establishing yourself as the adtech platform for the fast web. Join the hundreds of technology platforms currently supporting the open source AMP ecosystem.

AMP offers a way for you to give users a faster experience everywhere: on ads, landing pages or on your entire website. AMP ads help users engage with your brand and improve the performance of your campaigns. When your target audience lands on an AMP page, they get what they’re looking for in the moment they’re looking for it. The net result – they’re more likely to be engaged with and receptive to your brand’s messages, and more likely to take the actions you’re guiding them towards like completing a purchase.
