## Why should I use AMP?
# Improve user engagement with rich and immersive AMP ads
[/stage]

Advertising continues to be the cornerstone of every publisher’s business model; AMP is fundamentally changing the way ads are built and delivered on the web by supporting ads that are fast, safe, compelling and effective for users.

AMP ads greatly improve the mobile internet through their intelligent design and pre-loading features. This leads to increased traffic,higher sales conversion rates and more pages per visit – delivering the value you’re looking for in your ads.

## Benefits for developers
### End to end experience is controlled

As the owner of your AMP website and ads, no other parties can modify or add things, ensuring you are in control of the user experience and there won’t be any unexpected surprises. AMP ads are part of a user-first ecosystem and function the way a reasonable user would expect them to.

Optimized AMP ads don’t drain the battery life of mobile devices, and clicking on them will lead to AMP pages, which are equally as fast and streamlined.

### Reduce complexity in your operations
AMP is simple and straightforward and quickly becoming the turnkey solution for building pages. AMP supports both traditional ads, and the faster, more secure AMPHTML ads. Ads on AMP pages are like any external resource and must play within the same constraints placed on all resources in AMP.

Get started by leveraging the open-source AMPHTML ad templates.

### Quick and easy to build
The AMP Project has a vast network of resources for getting started in the Documentation section including great-looking ad templates, demos and examples. AMPHTML ads are flexible and dynamic, allowing for many creative formats like carousel, parallax, and lightbox, to name a few.

## Benefits for your business
#### Measure viewability
AMPHTML ads are 6x faster than regular ads on AMP pages, making them more viewable, more effective and more likely to perform well. You can monitor performance and adjust pricing accordingly, and offer the most engaging ad products to optimize your ad placements. In AMP, tweaking your pages to drive higher viewability rate or views is easy for publishers using the ‘data-loading-strategy’ attribute on the `amp-ad` component.

### Maximize your revenue
In order to engage with your brand and improve the performance of your campaigns, you have to speed things up. AMP Ads load on average 5x faster than the non-AMP version, leading to higher conversion rates. Because AMPHTML ads are 3x lighter, the AMP framework guarantees that these ads only behave as intended so users always have a positive experience with your brand.

In general we support the latest two versions of major browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, Opera and UC Browser. We support desktop, phone, tablet and the webview version of these respective browsers.

Beyond that, the core AMP library and built-in elements should aim for very wide browser support and we accept fixes for all browsers with market share greater than 1 percent.
In particular, we try to maintain “it might not be perfect but isn’t broken”-support for the Android 4.0 system browser and Chrome 28+ on phones.
