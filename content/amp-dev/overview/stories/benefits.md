### Built for the open web
AMP stories are part of the open web and can be shared and embedded across sites and apps without being confined to a single ecosystem. Flexibility means the potential to reach many more readers, as they can be seamlessly embedded across platforms.

Just like any web page, a publisher hosts an AMP story HTML page on their site and can link to it from any other part of their site to drive discovery. And, as with all content in the AMP ecosystem, discovery platforms can employ techniques like pre-renderable pages, optimized video loading and caching to optimize delivery to the end user.
