## Why should I use AMP?
# Improve user engagement with rich and immersive AMP websites
[/stage]

AMP recognizes the need to deliver fast and compelling user experiences across all screens. The reason websites made using AMP are so fast is the combined optimizations which make them appear to load almost instantly. AMP components are carefully designed for a better user experience with a responsive design to make sure they don’t cause performance degradation, ensuring your ability to monetize, optimize, and track the performance of your revenue streams.

## Benefits for developers
### Quick and easy to build
Since “AMP HTML” is built entirely out of existing web technologies, the development process mirrors the one publishers and advertisers are already using today. AMP’s ready made and customized components do the heavy lifting, allowing publishers and content providers to focus on content.
Publishers and advertisers can familiarize themselves with the AMP HTML specification on GitHub.

### Safe HTML code
As the owner of your AMP website, no other parties can modify or add things, ensuring you are in control of the user experience and content. AMP HTML specifications and style restrictions guarantee certain baseline performance characteristics. The goal is to minimize size recalculations which cause performance degradation. Interactive page features are handled in custom AMP elements to maintain a responsive design.

### Collaborative project
AMP is built thanks to a deep collaboration with thousands of developers, publishers and websites, distribution platforms and tech companies. AMP pages are part of the open web and can be shared and embedded across sites and apps without being confined to a single ecosystem. The AMP project offers numerous tutorials, guides, and assistance for you to make the transition to AMP in the Documentation page.

## Benefits for your business
### Reliable speed measurements
AMP is already very fast due to its optimizations, and the second level of speed-up is achieved through caching by AMP Caches. But the most impactful level of speed improvement is achieved through safe prerendering. The advantage of prerendering, is to make it possible to start render pretty much instantaneously (66ms) and for content to be visually complete and interactive after approximately 1s.

### Brings power and speed to your website
AMP websites load fast and provide an effortless and entertaining web experience. By using the AMP format, content producers are making the content in AMP files available to be crawled, indexed & displayed and cached by third parties. Learn more about the power and flexibility of building interactive AMP pages in the <amp-bind> documentation and from other dynamic AMP components.

### Improves ranking and increases visibility
Using the AMP format will make it far more compelling for people to consume and engage with more content. AMP also promotes enhanced distribution so that publishers and advertisers can take advantage of the open web’s potential for their content to appear everywhere quickly – across platforms and apps – which leads to improved visibility.

### AMP works for all browsers

In general we support the latest two versions of major browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, Opera and UC Browser. We support desktop, phone, tablet and the webview version of these respective browsers.

Beyond that, the core AMP library and built-in elements should aim for very wide browser support and we accept fixes for all browsers with market share greater than 1 percent.

In particular, we try to maintain “it might not be perfect but isn’t broken”-support for the Android 4.0 system browser and Chrome 28+ on phones.

### AMP is supported by many different platforms and vendors
