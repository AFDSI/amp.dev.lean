# Supported CSS

Like all web pages, AMP pages are styled with CSS, but you canâ€™t reference external stylesheets (with the exception of custom fonts). Also certain styles are disallowed due to performance implications.

Styles may live in the head of the document or as inline style attributes (see [Add styles](/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/design/responsive/art-direction.html) to a page). But you can use CSS preprocessors and templating to build static pages to better manage your content.
