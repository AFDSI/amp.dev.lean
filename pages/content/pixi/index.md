The AMP page experience guide is a tool that shows AMP developers how their AMP pages are performing against the Google Search page experience ranking signal, and provides actionable feedback on how they can improve.

If we aren't able to provide you with actionable insights please use the available prompts to [file an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Type:+Page+experience&template=page-experience.md&title=Page+experience+issue) so our team can help you understand how your AMP pages can be improved.

We use publicly available APIs such as [PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/), [Safe Browsing](https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing/v4/lookup-api), and [Mobile-friendliness Test](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly).
