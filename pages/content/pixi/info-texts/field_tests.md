While testing in the lab is a reasonable proxy for performance,
it isn't necessarily reflective of how all users experience
your site in the wild.

The performance of a site can vary dramatically based on a number
of factors, including, user's device capabilities and their
network conditions. The only way to truly know how your site
performs for your users is to actually measure its performance
as those users are loading and interacting with it. This type
of measurement is commonly referred to as 
[Real User Monitoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_user_monitoring)
â€” or RUM for short.

(RUM), highlights performance factors that lab tests may overlook.
RUM is the only way to measure how your site performs for your users.
