We noticed that some
render-blocking components are being used on your AMP page. While these can
provide useful and unique user experiences on your AMP page, they can also have
a negative impact on LCP. If you are having trouble meeting performance
thresholds while using these components, please file an issue on GitHub so AMP
can help you improve your page.
