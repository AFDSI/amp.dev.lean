## Welcome Back

In the previous course, we learned how to create a basic AMP site by starting a website for our fictional Chico's Cheese Bike shop. We also learned how to add static content to our site using AMP components. We added a carousel of images, social media posts, a video, and other essential elements.

Now, we want to give users new ways to interact with our site. For example:

- We need a slide-out menu to let users to navigate between pages.

- To collect information about our users, we'll add a newsletter subscription form.

Now we know what new features to create. How are we going to build them? We can build up our features by component composition - by combining components and having them work together. To do this, first, we'll identify the requirements of the feature we want to build. Second, we'll look for basic HTML elements and AMP components that satisfy our requirements. Lastly, we'll connect the components together.

Along the way, we'll also:

- Learn how AMP handles user interaction with event handlers and actions.

- Discuss how to collect user information using `<amp-form>`.

- Explain how to format server data using AMP mustache templates.

- Explore how to enhance a feature with added components and interactions.

## Course Prerequisites

This course is designed for web developers who want to build performant websites with AMP. It is intended to be a continuation of the beginning course. As such, it assumes an understanding of the concepts covered there, like:

- AMP page structure

- AMP boilerplate

- the AMP Validator

- how to use the AMP component documentation

- the AMP cache

If any of these topics are unfamiliar to you, we suggest reviewing the material from the beginning course here.

## Getting Set Up

In this course, we will continue using [Glitch](https://glitch.com). If you completed the beginning course, you can continue to use the same Glitch repository to complete the intermediate training. If you'd like to start from a new Glitch repository, you can remix [this](https://glitch.com/~aquamarine-baritone) one, which has all of the code already implemented.

Want to learn more about Glitch? You can read about it in the [appendix]({{g.doc('/content/amp-dev/documentation/courses/beginning-course/appendix.md', locale=doc.locale).url.path}}).

This course also requires the AMP Validator. The AMP Validator is a tool for detecting errors in our AMP pages. The Chrome extension provides one convenient way to access the validator. To install the Chrome extension, visit this link [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/amp-validator/nmoffdblmcmgeicmolmhobpoocbbmknc/related?hl=en).

Ready? Let's get started!
