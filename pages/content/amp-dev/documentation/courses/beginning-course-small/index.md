AMP is a web components library, a set of best practices, and a caching scheme. Together, these can help developers create performant, interactive websites quickly.

Many users access websites on slower connections and lower-powered devices. When websites are developed only for the fastest connections and devices, the experience of many users suffers. Thus, AMP works to improve web performance by:

- Extending HTML by adding tags for common website features.

- Reducing JavaScript.

- Detecting problems early and often during the course of website development.

- Caching pages for optimal performance.

AMP places restrictions on where and how you can use JavaScript. This restriction can dramatically improve performance on mobile devices. AMP's web components are designed to provide most of this functionality - which means you no longer have to write as much JavaScript or rely on third-party libraries. Otherwise, AMP has much in common with other front-end frameworks - so the skills you'll acquire while

The benefits of AMP don’t end once your page is deployed. Companies like Google and Microsoft have created caches which store AMP pages that have no validation errors. These caches can apply powerful performance optimizations to your site’s content without affecting the way your users experience it. Cached AMP pages are also integrated with search engines so that your site can be reached from search results within seconds - or even less!
