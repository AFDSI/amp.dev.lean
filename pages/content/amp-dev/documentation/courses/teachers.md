Whether on video sites, e-commerce pages, or online email clients, often websites look different depending on who is accessing the site and when. These types of websites dynamically generate the content on screen by combining templates with data from a server. In the final course in this series, we’ll explore how to retrieve data from a server and display that information on screen. We’ll also explore the concept of application state variables and bindings, and how to use these concepts with AMP. We will complete our cheese bikes site by refactoring our components to use state and bingins, and we will add a sortable, filterable product page! In addition, we will look at examples of popular genres of dynamic websites, and we’ll attempt to recreate simple versions of these sites using AMP.

## About the Course

### Course Objective:

The goals of this course are to:

- Introduce the AMP approach to building engaging, performant web experiences

### Prerequisites:

- basic JavaScript expressions and JSON

### Requirements:

- Internet connection

- Chrome browser, ideally, so that the AMP Validator extension can be used

- We use the online editor Glitch. No IDE or local web server is required!

### Course materials

The course consists of a series of hands-on codelabs, most of which step you through the process of creating an AMP page for an imaginary shop. You can complete the codelabs in any order, but the more advanced codelabs build on the fundamentals covered in the earlier codelabs.
