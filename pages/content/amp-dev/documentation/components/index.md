# Component Overview

[intro]
The AMP HTML library provides components that are classified as:â€¨

- **built-in:** Components that are included in the base library, such as amp-img and amp-pixel.
- **extended:** Extensions to the base library that must be explicitly included in the document as custom elements(e.g., ```<scriptasynccustom-element="amp-audio"```).
- **experimental:** Components that are released but are not yet ready for wide use.
