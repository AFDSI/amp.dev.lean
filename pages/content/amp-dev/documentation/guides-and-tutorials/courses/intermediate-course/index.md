Interactive website are critical to serve our customers and drive engagement. Users might use keyboards, mice, or touch to interact with our site. They might interact directly with components or provide information using forms. In this course, we introduce how to watch for and respond to user interaction with AMP. We cover the basics of events, event handlers, and actions. Along the way, we also discuss the topics of accessibility and how to build forms with AMP. Finally, we discuss how to combine components to build more comprehensive features. We will practice these skills by continuing to build our cheese bike website. Weâ€™ll add a slide out navigation menu, a newsletter subscription form, and a more complex interactive image carousel.
