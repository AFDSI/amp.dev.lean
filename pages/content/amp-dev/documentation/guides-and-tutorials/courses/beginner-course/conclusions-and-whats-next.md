Congratulations! You’ve finished the introduction to AMP beginners’ course and have successfully created your first AMP page.

Reflect on what you’ve built so far. You’ve created an engaging AMP webpage, with images, a carousel, and video. Think of all the work we didn’t have to do, like writing JavaScript that allowed us to keep track of what slide of our carousel we were on, or figuring out how to wrap our carousel around from the last slide to the first slide. Instead of getting bogged down in details and busy work, we were able to focus on building the type of site that was most effective for our burgeoning cheese bike business.

As you have seen in this course, there are AMP components for most modern website features. Like we’ve been doing so far, we can often build full-featured sites with very little additional coding just by using these components.
During this course, you also learned how to find and use AMP components to build simple user interfaces. You were introduced to the power and simplicity of AMP and the tools it offers. Finally, you learned about the AMP Validator and the important role it plays in enabling the AMP cache.
In our next course, we’ll learn how to handle user input and events, how to invoke actions on an AMP component to change its state or appearance, and how to combine multiple AMP components to make more elaborate user interfaces. We will continue to expand on Chico’s Cheese Bikes shop to give Chico’s the chance to continue to impress potential cheese-loving cyclists.
