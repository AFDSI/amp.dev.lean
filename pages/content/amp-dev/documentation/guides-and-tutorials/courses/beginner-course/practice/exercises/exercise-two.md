## Different Layouts!

Up until now, in all amp elements we have used, we have marked them with a responsive layout attribute. As we discussed during the course, in a responsive layout the element is resized automatically to take up all available space, maintaining the aspect ratio calculated by its given width and height. We marked all elements as such because we wanted to make sure that our website will look good on different screen sizes. This way, the content size responds to the change in the screen size.
