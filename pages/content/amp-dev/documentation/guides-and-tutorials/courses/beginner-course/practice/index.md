## Introduction

You should, by now, have finished the tutorial part of the Basic Course on AMP. Chico’s Cheese bike shop should have its website up and running by now!
Let’s add some more functionalities to it, to make it even fancier!

## Get set up

We will be using [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) to complete our course. If you are not familiar with Glitch or online code editors in general, jump to the relevant section of the beginner’s course to get a general idea (link here to “an introduction to the online coding environment!” of Beginner’s course).

You can either use the project you are already working on (the one you just built in the Beginner’s Course), or use our own version of the already completed Beginner’s Course project.

If you want to use our own version:
Visit [this link](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/aquamarine-baritone) to open the Course project (it’s where we left off in the Beginner’s course). On the top right click “Remix This”. This will create a new project that you can now edit! This new project will be your own personal copy, and if you log into Glitch it will be on your profile, yours to edit it however you want! Click on “Show Live” to see your page.

We’re all set, now!
