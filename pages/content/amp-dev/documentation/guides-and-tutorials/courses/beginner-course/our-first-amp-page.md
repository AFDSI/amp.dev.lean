[TOC]

Before our bike shop site becomes fancy, it starts as just a sparse HTML page. The first step towards our goal is to turn a basic, no frills HTML page into the smallest possible AMP page. Oftentimes in development we call the most simple thing we can build in a new technology a “Hello World” example. We’re going to start our journey towards learning AMP by building a Hello World example using AMP.

To begin, in our Glitch project, open index.html and verify that the HTML looks like this:

[sourcecode:html]
{% raw %}<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Chico's Cheese Bicycles</title>
    <link rel="shortcut icon" href="https://cdn.glitch.com/d7f46a57-0ca4-4cca-ab0f-69068dec6631%2Fcheese-favicon.png?1540228964214">
  </head>
  <body>
    <header class="headerbar">
      <h2>Chico's Cheese Bicycles</h2>
    </header>
    <main>
      <div class="main-content">
        <img alt="Ricotta Racer" src="images/ricotta-racer.jpg"></img>
        <div class="below-hero">
          <h2 class="main-heading">What we're about</h2>
          <p class="main-text">We sell the only ten-speed bicycles in the
            world made entirely of cheese. They get
            you where you need to go, and you never arrive hungry.
            Our bikes are 100% biodegradable. And with
            our new rodent-repelling varnish they last longer than ever!
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
{% endraw %}[/sourcecode]

## Marking our site as an AMP page

The first change we must to make to our site to indicate that our HTML page is meant to be an AMP page is to add some decoration to our HTML tag. If the html tag contains a ⚡ symbol or the word amp, then tools like the AMP validator (see below) and the AMP cache will try to read and execute our site as an AMP site.

In your project, add the ⚡ symbol to the html tag, like this:

[sourcecode:html]
{% raw %}<html ⚡ lang="en">{% endraw %}[/sourcecode]

It might seem trivial, but this symbol is very important! Now our tools will know we’re trying to make an AMP site, and they can help us figure out the rest of the changes we need to make to properly convert the rest of the site to the AMP format.

## Tracking errors with the AMP Validator

Our page is being treated as an AMP page, but we still have more to do until it’s a valid AMP page. The AMP validator will tell us how much work is left to do. The validator will show us all of the things that are preventing our page from being as fast as it could be. Once we’ve addresses all the issues generated by the validator, our pages will be properly understood and can be fully optimized by the AMP library and by the AMP cache (to be explored later).

So, how do we run the validator? After you have installed the AMP Validator Chrome extension, the validator will automatically run on any open page that has the AMP symbol (⚡) in it’s html tag like ours does now.

{{ image('/static/img/courses/beginner/image11.png', 311, 550, caption='The AMP Validator Chrome extension showing AMP issues.') }}

{{ image('/static/img/courses/beginner/image2.png', 311, 550, caption='The issues displayed in the AMP Validator Chrome Extension.') }}

Opening our site so far, we can now see several issues in our basic AMP page. We’ll take care of all of these issues soon enough. First though, we cannot yet use any of the new AMP features, because we haven’t yet added the rest of the AMP library to our site.

So, let’s add the AMP library and boilerplate to see what happens!

## Adding the AMP boilerplate

Each AMP page contains a number of additional tags within the <head> tag that are necessary for the page to be valid. Some tags are dependent on the content of your page, so you only need to include them if you use certain AMP features or components in your page. However, some tags are always required on every AMP page. These tags that are always required are called the “AMP boilerplate”. No matter what type of AMP site you’re trying to build, you always include these tags as you see them below. If ever you’re missing any tags, the AMP Validator will inform you via validation errors.

The bulk of the validation errors in our current project can be solved simply by adding the AMP boilerplate to our site. To do this, add the following block of code to the end of the head tag in our index.html file:  

[sourcecode:html]
{% raw %}<script async src="https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0.js"></script>
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1">
<link rel="canonical" href="https://www.site.com/amp/document.html">
<style amp-boilerplate>body{-webkit-animation:-amp-start 8s steps(1,end) 0s 1 normal both;-moz-animation:-amp-start 8s steps(1,end) 0s 1 normal both;-ms-animation:-amp-start 8s steps(1,end) 0s 1 normal both;animation:-amp-start 8s steps(1,end) 0s 1 normal both}@-webkit-keyframes -amp-start{from{visibility:hidden}to{visibility:visible}}@-moz-keyframes -amp-start{from{visibility:hidden}to{visibility:visible}}@-ms-keyframes -amp-start{from{visibility:hidden}to{visibility:visible}}@-o-keyframes -amp-start{from{visibility:hidden}to{visibility:visible}}@keyframes -amp-start{from{visibility:hidden}to{visibility:visible}}</style><noscript><style amp-boilerplate>body{-webkit-animation:none;-moz-animation:none;-ms-animation:none;animation:none}</style></noscript>
{% endraw %}[/sourcecode]

[tip type="note"]
Note:
The amp-boilerplate code must be copied and pasted as-is. The code is minified as it is displayed above, but it’s OK if you are using an auto-formatter on your code, such as Prettier. Just make sure not to change the order of text inside of the tags above or change the values. If you want to know more about what these tags in the AMP boilerplate mean and why they are important, you can read about them in the appendix.
[/tip]

Now open your page and open the Chrome DevTools (Command+Option+I on Mac or Control+Shift+I on Windows/Linux, by default) and select the Console tab. You should see this message in the console indicating that the AMP library was successfully loaded:

[sourcecode:text]
Powered by AMP ⚡ HTML
[/sourcecode]

## CSS and AMP

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) let you customize the look of your webpage. You will almost always add custom styles to your AMP pages, but AMP places some restrictions for performance reasons  on the use of CSS: 

* Styles may only live in the head of the document inside a `<style amp-custom>` tag or as inline style attributes, if needed. 
* An AMP page may only have one `<style amp-custom>` tag (decorated style tag).
* There is a 50kb size limit to all included styles
* The !important rule is restricted.
* For more disallowed or restricted CSS rules you should check the [documentation](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/design/responsive/style_pages).

To practice adding custom styles to your AMP page, add the following `<style amp-custom>` tag to your page in the `<head>` like this and see what happens to the page!

[sourcecode:html]
{% raw %}<style amp-custom>
    body {
        font-family: sans-serif;
        line-height: 1.5rem;
        min-width: 315px;
    }
</style>
{% endraw %}[/sourcecode]

To help us build Chico’s Cheese Bike site, we’ve provided some CSS to use throughout the various trainings. Styling website with CSS is generally outside the scope of this course, so the given styles just give us some baseline aesthetic to work from. If you open [this project](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/hungry-modem), you will see that the `<style amp-custom>` tag is there with all the styles you need. If you want, you can use [this project](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/hungry-modem) from now on, or simply copy the styles to the project you’ve been working with.

## Almost there!

By now, if you followed all the steps above, your page should almost be a valid AMP page. If you open the console or the AMP Validator Chrome Extension, you’ll see we’re down to the last error:

[sourcecode:text]
The tag 'img' may only appear as a descendant of tag 'noscript'. Did you mean 'amp-img'?
[/sourcecode]

This is a really important error! Some HTML tags are not allowed in AMP documents or they have alternative versions that must be used in AMP pages instead. We call these custom, non-standard HTML tags “components,” and we discuss them at length later in the training.

[tip type="tip"]
If our page was empty, we would now have a valid AMP site. You can start all your future AMP pages using this HTML here as a starting point. It contains all the required tags and elements we talked about.
