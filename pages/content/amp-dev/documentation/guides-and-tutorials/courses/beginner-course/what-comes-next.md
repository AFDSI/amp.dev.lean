## What Comes Next

Well, congratulations! You’ve finished the AMP Basics course and have successfully created your first AMP page! During this course, you converted a simple HTML page into an AMP page, adding the necessary elements and attributes, and of course installing the AMP runtime script! You also learned how to find and use AMP components to build simple user interfaces. You explored several common components of AMP, including amp-img, amp-youtube, amp-twitter, amp-carousel, and amp-social-share! You were introduced to the power and simplicity of AMP and the tools it offers. Finally, you learned what the AMP validator is and the important role it plays in enabling the AMP cache.

In our next course, we’ll learn how to handle user input and events, how to invoke actions on particular AMP components that support them and how to combine multiple AMP components to make more complicated user interfaces. We will continue to expand on Chico’s Cheese Bike shop, to give Chico the chance to continue to impress their users and hungry cyclists. When you’re ready, we hope to see you in the intermediate training!
