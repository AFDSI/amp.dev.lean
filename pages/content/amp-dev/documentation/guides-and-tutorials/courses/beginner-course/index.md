The web is wonderful, but it is difficult to build performance, accessible, and responsive web experiences that work well on all devices. AMP is here to help. In this course, we explore what AMP is, the architecture of AMP, and how to convert a simple HTML page into a valid AMP page. We also introduce the concept of components and the benefits they provide. Finally, we practice using AMP by building a sample site with images, videos, a carousel, and more!

## About the Course

### Course Objective:

The goals of this course are to:

- Teach modern website development patterns and how to implement them in AMP

- Introduce the AMP approach to building engaging, performant web experiences

### Prerequisites:

- basic understanding of HTML and CSS

### Requirements:

- Internet connection

- Chrome browser, ideally, so that the AMP Validator extension can be used

- We use the online editor Glitch. No IDE or local web server is required!

### Course materials

The course consists of a series of hands-on codelabs, most of which step you through the process of creating an AMP page for an imaginary shop. You can complete the codelabs in any order, but the more advanced codelabs build on the fundamentals covered in the earlier codelabs.
