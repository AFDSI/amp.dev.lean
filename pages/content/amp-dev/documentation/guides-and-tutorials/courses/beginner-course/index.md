The web is wonderful, but it is difficult to build performance, accessible, and responsive web experiences that work well on all devices. AMP is here to help. In this course, we explore what AMP is, the architecture of AMP, and how to convert a simple HTML page into a valid AMP page. We also introduce the concept of components and the benefits they provide. Finally, we practice using AMP by building a sample site with images, videos, a carousel, and more!
