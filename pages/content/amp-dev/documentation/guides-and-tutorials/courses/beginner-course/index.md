## Why AMP?

On the Internet, performance matters. Especially now that the majority of users browse using a mobile device. The users of sites that load faster tend to have longer browsing sessions and higher engagement. Conversely, over half of mobile users give up on websites if they do not load within three seconds.

So, if performance is so important, then why are so many modern website loading and running so slowly for mobile users? The truth is, it’s often complicated to build fast websites that are also full of features, look good on all device sizes, and are intuitive to use. We believe that developers want to make fast sites, but many libraries and frameworks make it too easy to do the wrong things. Therefore, AMP was created to make it easy for developers to do the right things, so those developers can focus on building better features without customers having a poor user experience!

## How AMP helps

AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) is a set of best practices and an accompanying library that make it easy to do the right things when developing a website. Using AMP is a great way to learn web development, because AMP sites are:

* Built using standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
* Compatible with all modern browsers
* Not dependent on special build tools or servers in order to get a site up and running

AMP helps developers create fast web experiences that are easy to maintain. AMP introduces a set of requirements (and a validation tool that helps enforce those requirements) that, when followed, help pages load quickly, consume fewer system resources, reflect best practices for accessibility and performance, and help other typical features like ads run smoothly.

In exchange for these performance gains, AMP places some restrictions on developers, such as limiting the ways that custom JavaScript can be executed and restricting which HTML tags may be used on your sites. However, these restrictions allow for powerful and automatic performance optimizations and caching that help your pages load fast and help you avoid many of the biggest and most harmful user experience and performance pitfalls. Pages delivered from such caches get downloaded in the background on sites like Google and can be loaded in less than half a second from when the site is requested.

## A*M*P is not just for *M*obile

AMP is not just for building static content pages, and despite the name, nor is it just for mobile websites. The AMP format is useful for building performant desktop web experiences as well. Despite limitations on the usage of JavaScript on AMP pages, AMP components can be combined together to build feature-rich websites that respond in real time to user input and display dynamic content from remote servers.

AMP provides tools to handle many of the challenges of building modern websites, such as component-based design, state management and dynamic content generation, in a way that prevents the type of code bloat that negatively affects performance. If some of these concepts of building websites don’t sound familiar to you, don’t worry! Throughout this and future trainings, you will learn about many of these concepts. You don’t need to know all of these concepts in order to start building great AMP experiences for your users.


## Learning AMP to learn web development

The skills acquired and patterns learned while building AMP pages can be transferred to building websites in any other format or framework. Like most modern frameworks, AMP is a component-based approach to designing and building websites. There is a large library of existing AMP components that help developers rapidly build performant web experiences without having to write a lot of custom code. Developers will learn to develop websites with recognized best practices for using HTML and CSS, start thinking in components, and will learn to avoid bad habits - skills that will be effective when building sites in any other framework.
