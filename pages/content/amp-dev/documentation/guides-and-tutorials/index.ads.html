<h1>AMPHTML Ads</h1>
<p class="limit">AMP Ads deliver effective, safe, and compelling HTML ads that keep pages fast and lean. AMPHTML ads are a faster, lighter and more secure way to advertise on the web. AMP ads are only delivered after being validated, ensuring that the ads are free of malware. Most of all, these ads can be delivered anywhere on the web, not just on AMP pages.</p>
