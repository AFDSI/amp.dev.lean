<h1>Introduction to AMP for Email</h1>
<p class="limit">AMP for Email allows you to create interactive emails using a subset of components from the AMPHTML library. AMP emails can update dynamically, allowing readers to view and interact with AMP components directly in the message.</p>

<h2>AMP for Email Providers</h2>
<p>Bring interactive mail to your users by integrating the <a href="{{ g.doc('/content/amp-dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/contribute/integrate-amphtml-email.md', locale=doc.locale).url.path }}">AMPHTML Email specification with your platform</a>. Get started by reading the base requirements and get in touch with our team through <a href="https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>.</p>

<h2>Get Involved</h2>
<p>AMP is proudly an open source project with an active community of contributors. We welcome and appreciate documentation and translation contributions! Check out our community section to join our mission to make the web suck less.</p>
