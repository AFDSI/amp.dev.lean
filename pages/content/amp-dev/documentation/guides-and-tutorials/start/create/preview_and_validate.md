We’re using the power of the AMP Playground to preview our page and ensure it’s valid AMP during our development process. Making your AMP pages valid is a worthy goal, as a valid AMP page means it’s following strict guidelines that enhance [Page Experience](https://amp.dev/about/page-experience/) and make it eligible for [caching](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/amp-caches-and-cors/how_amp_pages_are_cached/?format=websites)! Documents served from an AMP Cache are preloaded efficiently and safely, and perform user-beneficial performance optimizations to page content.

Unfortunately, using the AMP Playground to check all your pages wouldn’t be practical for a multi-page site. Find what works for you by reading more about how to automate AMP’s [Validation workflow](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/validation-workflow/validate_amp/?format=websites) and what to do if you [encounter errors](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/amp-actions-and-events/?format=websites).
