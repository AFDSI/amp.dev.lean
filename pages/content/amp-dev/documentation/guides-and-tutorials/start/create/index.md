In this tutorial, we’ll introduce you to the basics of an AMP page. Follow these steps to get started learning how AMP is unique, checking if a page is valid, and taking next steps to publishing it to the web.

AMP pages that pass validation are more likely to meet [Page Experience metrics](https://amp.dev/about/page-experience/) and enable caching! If you are uninterested in AMP cache benefits or unable to switch to fully valid AMP but still want to use AMP's components, check out [Bento AMP](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/start/bento_guide/?format=websites). Bento allows the use of AMP components everywhere on the web! It is also okay to create invalid AMP pages, but it isn't a directly supported use case and there's no guarantee that invalid AMP page will work correctly.

If you’re new to web development, you can learn the basics and AMP at the same time! Check out [AMP’s web development courses](https://amp.dev/documentation/courses/?format=websites&level=beginner) to get started.
