In this tutorial, we’ll introduce you to the basics of an AMP page. Follow these steps to get started learning how AMP is unique, checking if a page is valid, and taking next steps to publishing it to the web.

AMP pages that pass validation are more likely to meet [Page Experience metrics](https://amp.dev/about/page-experience/) and enable caching. If you are uninterested in AMP cache benefits, it is okay to create invalid AMP pages or use [Bento AMP](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/start/bento_guide/?format=websites).

If you’re new to web development, you can learn the basics and AMP at the same time! Check out [AMP’s web development courses](https://amp.dev/documentation/courses/?format=websites&level=beginner) to get started.
