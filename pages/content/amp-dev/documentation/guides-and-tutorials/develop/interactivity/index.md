In this tutorial, you'll learn how to use data binding and expressions to build awesome, interactive AMP pages with [`amp-bind`]({{g.doc('/content/amp-dev/documentation/components/reference/amp-bind.md', locale=doc.locale).url.path}}).

## What you'll build

You'll build an e-commerce product page that:

- Uses AMP HTML and AMP components for a fast and rich user experience.
- Includes cross-element interactivity by using [`amp-bind`]({{g.doc('/content/amp-dev/documentation/components/reference/amp-bind.md', locale=doc.locale).url.path}}).
- Fetches additional product data on demand by using [`<amp-state>`]({{g.doc('/content/amp-dev/documentation/components/reference/amp-bind.md', locale=doc.locale).url.path}}#state).
