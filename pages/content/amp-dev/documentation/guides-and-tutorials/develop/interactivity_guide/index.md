These guides outline how to create interactive AMP pages. Interactivity is essential to the modern web. Building unique and delightful experiences engages users, keeping them on your site. AMP provides out-of-the box solutions to common interactivity needs while also affording highly customized and flexible solutions.

Building interactive experiences in AMP may feel untraditional, and it is! But that doesn’t mean it’s more difficult. Many interactive experiences are very easy to build with AMP once you’re introduced to concepts and understand the syntax.

There are several levels of interactivity in AMP. You can apply one, multiple, all, or none to an AMP page. Read the sections of this guide to learn how to build interactivity in AMP.

# Interactivity foundations

This guide outlines the built-in interactivity AMP provides. It explains how to easily implement common primitives, such as hiding and showing elements.

Example (?)

Start here to learn foundations that you can build and combine with other interactive possibilities.

# Ready-made interactivity with AMP components

One of AMP’s greatest strengths is its extensive library of ready-to-go components. Many of them are interactive elements that you can customize and combine to build unique experiences!

Example (?)

This guide introduces the most common interactive components and outlines implementation patterns.

# Building custom interactive experiences

While AMP provides excellent solutions to common web widgets and interactivity, each website has its own needs. AMP embraces highly customizable experiences with three components: amp-selector, amp-bind, and amp-script.

Example (?)

Use this guide as an introduction to the differences between the three, how and if they should be combined, and how to use them with other elements.

# Client-side rendering

This guide outlines client-side rendering possibilities in AMP. By default, AMP pages are server-side rendered. However, in certain cases it's necessary to dynamically render data on the client, such as a list of articles or items in a user’s shopping cart.

Example (?)

This guide will get you started with AMP components and concepts that enable rendering on the client-side.
